// User Select
// The user-select property in CSS controls how the text in an element is allowed to be selected. For example, it can be used to make text unselectable.
/* Examples: 
    @include user-select(none);
    @include user-select(all);
*/
@mixin user-select($user-select) {
    user-select: ($user-select);
}
